hero_description@: Chiappera is the last Valle Maira inhabited village, situated at the bottom of the Rocca Provenzale and the Stroppia Waterfalls. The untouched and untamed nature of the valley has transformed Chiappera in the perfect departing point for hiking and mountain bike trips, rock climbing and relaxing walks, surrounded by a breathtaking landscape. The Meizoun del Muret offers to its residents total independence during their stay, with two available apartments equipped at best for every need.
